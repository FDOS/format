INSTALL

To compile the source code you need (version 0.91 or newer):

1.  Borland Turbo C 2.01 or Turbo C++ 3.0 or compatible.
    (FORMAT 0.90 and older versions may need Turbo C++ 3.0 ...)
2.  The included source code and header files (*.c and *.h)
    (FORMAT 0.89 / older may also need extra files from fdisk to compile)
    ... and the makefiles / config files for your compiler (see below).
3.  A PC running some form of DOS.  (Probably greater than MS-DOS 4.0.)
4.  Any reasonable 'make' utility (Borland includes one)


Compilation instructions:


1.  Go into the 'source' directory


For Turbo C++ 3:
2.  Edit the 'format.mak' makefile to make sure CC and CFLAGS match
      your C compiler.
3.  Type:
       make -fformat.mak


For Turbo C 2.01:
2.  Edit the 'turboc.cfg' file to point to your Turbo C directories,
    with an '-lincludedirectory' and an '-Llibrarydirectory' line.
3.  Type (uses the 'makefile' file - edit that if you need other flags):
       make


4.  You will have the executable in the source directory. Move it to
    a directory of your choice (preferably in your path).
    Delete *.obj and *.map after compilation if you want.
