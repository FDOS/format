Known bugs and problems (in 0.91k / known by Brian or Eric):
*** = bug which is definitely still an issue in 0.91t...
Please test and tell if the non-*** problems are REALLY fixed now!



*** There should be error handling that allows you to retry when format or
    disk read / write errors happen (beyond the default "try N times").
    Partially fixed in 0.91n by allowing noncritical disk I/O to fail.

*** Could use separate error messages for CD-ROM, remote, SUBST...


    Will, under some circumstances, fail to format due to dma overruns.
    Fixed in 0.91?

    The FAT32 format may not be compatible with MS's operating systems.
    Fixed in 0.91i? When running FORMAT itself under MS operating systems,
    things are more complicated. Should be fixed in 0.91q (not o), though.

    Floppy format to smaller sizes than the drive default sometimes fails.
    (seems to work much better in 0.91c??) 720k are most tricky here.
    Formats with more than standard TRACKS only work on "generous" drives!
    However, both 1440k and 1680k work fine in 1440k drives :-).
    Even 720k support to work now in 0.91o, finally, but you have to use
    real DD diskettes for that. USB floppy ONLY supports exact 1440k size.

    Format after FDISK screwed up (uformat mode active here)...
    Fixed in 0.91d? 
    Looks as if sometimes the kernel (int 21.440d.?860) returns 0 cluster
    size while other BPB values are all okay, e.g. on some SCSI systems!?
    Possible background: FreeDOS kernel 2035 and older use wrong subunit
    number for user block device drivers for IOCTL. Fixed in 2035-devel.
