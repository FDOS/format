Future Plans

TO-DO         Add international language support (e.g. with KITTEN library).

TO-DO         Debug FAT32 support. Debug all mirror / unformat data writes.
              FAT32 mirror data partially done in 0.91k - depends on your
              UNFORMAT whether more mirroring is required. To make things
              easier, 0.91l now contains a builtin UNFORMAT. Improved FAT32
              MIRROR and Win9x compatibility in 0.91p and 0.91q (again).

TO-DO         Fix any other bugs (see bugs.txt).

TO-DO         Clean up the source code, for example: Remove duplicate
              duplicate sanity checks. Maybe add checks for division by 0:
              0 sec/fat, 0 sec/clust, 0 sec/disk, too few sec/disk...


TO-DO (half)  Release filesystem locks (Win9x) when FORMAT has to give up
              before completing the format process. Otherwise, the system
              could be left in a "dangling" state, esp. for 0.91q / newer.
              (half-done: ctrl-c handler missing, otherwise done, 0.91r)

TO-DO (half)  Modify safe formatting such that it avoids overwriting data. 
              (e.g. create a mirror.fil before deleting the file system...)
              (for now, 0.91r+: mirroring just fails if it would o/w data.)


TO-DO (maybe) Support sector sizes other than 512 bytes (64, 128, 256...).

TO-DO (maybe) SET 40:[9x] values to use all drives on all (even XT) BIOSes?
              Optimize non-standard floppy format settings? (...)

TO-DO (maybe) Use bigger and aligned buffers for harddisk surface scan.
              Is a WRITE ONLY scan enough (HARDDISK has to detect errors)?

TO-DO (maybe) When system files are written, the summary must subtract the
              amount of space they take up from the total disk space.
              (We just call the SYS tool to write the system files...)


      (done!) If the user did not give a /v:label option, then FORMAT is
              expected to ask for a label interactively (unless /y given).
              FORMAT now simply uses NO label / timestamp if no /v:... used!
              (added 0.91r)

      (done?) Use IOCTLs (int 21.4409, 21.440f, 21.440d.0860, 21.440d.0840)
              for drive type and DPB/BPB stuff? (done where useful < 0.91j)
              Notice that IOCTLs for drives with DEVICE= drivers do not work
              right for FreeDOS older than http://fdos.org/kernel/ 2035-dev!

      (done?) Have the program check to see if there is already an existing
              format (and what type of format) before the media is
              formatted. (Partially(?) implemented in FORMAT < 0.91j)

      (done?) Add the capability to utilize the non-standard floppy format
              features. (Add the appropriate switches to the command line.)
              (Partially implemented in 0.91c: 800k and 1680k work...)
              Note that USB floppy drives do NOT support non-standard sizes.

      (done?) QuickFormat and SafeFormat should preserve the list of bad
              clusters if one is found. Alternatively, one could always do
              full format if bad clusters are detected. Added in 0.91k.

      (done!) ASCII_CD_... now prints long numbers (like 1,234.5) in NLS /
              country aware style (0.91k).
