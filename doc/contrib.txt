Jan Verhoeven       Supplied the equations for converting the logical 
                    sectors to physical cylinders, heads, and sectors.

John Price          Supplied the algorithms for correctly computing the
                    number of sectors per FAT.

James Clark         Sent me information regarding IOCTL call 0x21440d,
                    functions 0x47 and 0x67.  These functions allow the
                    access flag to be set to force a DOS kernel to
                    allow interrupt 0x25/0x26 access to an unformatted
                    logical drive.

Tom Ehlert          Interrupt 0x25/0x26 code, portability enhancements,
                    improved error detection and trapping.

Bart Oldeman        Modified the FreeDOS kernel to support IOCTL call
                    0x21440d, function 0x67. Also assisted with
                    addition of FAT32 support (see news.txt re: version
                    0.90 for further info).

Jim Hall            Support for getopt, format.c cleanup, new makefile.

Eric Auer           Many changes, bug fixes and improvements for
                    versions 0.90b ... 0.91u in 2003, 2004 and 2005.

Anthony Williams    Rewrote OpenWatcom makefile, fixed some warnings
                    (and one potential bug).

Bernd Boeckmann     add support for 128K clusters, OpenWatcom makefile updates

Additional tests    2003/2004: Bernd Blaauw, Wilhelm Spiegl, Geraldo
                    Netto, David Flechl, Johnson Lam, Tyler H. D.,
                    Matthew Gruett and many others before. Using DOS
                    BOOTFIX, CHKDSK, DOSFSCK, DOSEmu and other tools.
